# Code-wars

I added to this repo selected problems from CodeWars or Leetcode that I found challenging and interesting.

The most interesting one is a Loopover puzzle solver.

You can also look at the brainfuck section, where there are solutions for two quite hard problems. One involves comparing two strings (which only sounds simple), and the second is a program that creates another brainfuck program, which prints the entered symbol.
